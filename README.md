# DWARF 3 FITS to TIFF Converter

This script converts FITS files generated by the DWARF 3 telescope (or any other compatible FITS-based imaging system) into TIFF format for easier processing, visualization, or stacking in software like AutoStakkert. Though originally designed for solar photography, it can be used for other astronomical imaging types as well.

## Features
- Converts FITS files to TIFF format.
- Supports multiple folder inputs.
- Ignores "stacked" FITS files by default.
- Optionally reads `shotsInfo.json` to print metadata (if present in the folder).
- Converts data to 8-bit grayscale for TIFF output.
- Includes a progress bar to show conversion status.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `astropy`
- `Pillow` (PIL fork)
- `numpy`
- `tqdm`

To install the dependencies, use pip:
```bash
pip install astropy pillow numpy tqdm
